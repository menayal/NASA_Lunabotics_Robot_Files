Steps to get Gazebo to launch with your robot's URDF file. 

At this point, its already assumed that you have a URDF model and some the related files. If not, go through the tutorials at
	https://wiki.ros.org/urdf/Tutorials

Step 1) Launch robot model
CD into your directory or workspace  where the package is held.
Make sure you have sourced your workspace if you haven't already. (source devel/setup.bash)

roslaunch (package name) (launchfile)

Opens up model into rviz and then proceeds to open up Gazebo.
Gazebo shows model in a simulated world.

Two ways to control the robot at this point.
a. Use the sliders to control the robot 
	--use rqt_robot_steering package
		-- To use, simply use the sliders that have already popped up.
b. Use your keyoboard to move the robot
	--use the teleop_twist_keyboard package
		--To use, open up a new tab in your terminal. Keep that roslaunch file running. 
		--run the command:
		--rosrun teleop_twist_keyboard teleop_twist_keyboard.py cmd_vel:=/"your_robots_controller_for_the_wheels"/cmd_vel
		--To find "your_robots_controller_for_the_wheels" look into your launch file where you defined a ns for the wheels' controller. For instance, I named my ns for that controller "my_new_robot_diff_drive_controller"
		--rosrun teleop_twist_keyboard teleop_twist_keyboard.py cmd_vel:=/new_robot_urdf_diff_drive_controller/cmd_vel

Your robot can now move in Gazebo.
