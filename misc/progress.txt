Just created pubs and subs with python3. 

Need to create a urdf file, go through the tutorials.
	Create custom simple bot
	learn the other aspects of the bot ( launch files etc)
	start controlling with script
	key args use teleop keyboard , controller. 

1/8/22:
Created ros package and some launch files
make sure to source into the dir before u run commands
--need to figure out what other files i need to launch into gazebo
--maybe empty world?

need to add wheels,
the origin is in relation to the base, needs to be half measurement of rectangle of base, and half of the measurement of the wheel. 

look into ros_control.

add wheels ---
 2/3/22
TO DO
Add rest of robot
test it.

---
push changes
what is rqt manager, 
get bot to move with keyboard, DONE
talk to Dustin about what files do what etc.
research navigation and scripts to move bot. 
look into the camera sensors and obstacle avoidance. 

--
Look into sensors
look into creating nodes
	how they can communicate
	how start a sequence of mining something with the auger
	--using services/parameters?

	
use gazebo to sense an object and move left or right
	--messages? std_msgs/String message type -- is a message type, i think need to use from geometry_msgs.msg import Twist
	create more intricate path, obstacle avoidance

	rosrun pckage name py

	find out more about turtlsim.msg pose for gotogoal.py



work on moving left and right on move left py, then work on controller input and think about controller integration with motor. 
Look into install a sensor and obstacle avoidance. 

#downloaded https://github.com/ros-drivers/joystick_drivers/tree/melodic-devel ps3 controller pkg from github aka joystick_drivers
	--Error running catkin build for ros_catkin_ws i think bc of the joystick drivers pkgg 
	--Errors:

	--solution https://github.com/ros-drivers/joystick_drivers/issues/79   error fixed
	
	jstest not working so need to install joy packaggge

	install jstest gtk using sudo

need to map ps3 controls or see if they working correct. then try moving in gazbeo. 

	 
installed the teleop twist joy pkg
	only gets some feeddback, and is delayed.

Find out how and if ps3 controller is mapped correctly. and then get it into gazebo. 

to start using ps3 controller with inputs:

ls /dev/input
sudo jstest /dev/input/js2
make sure  to keep active, if off, turn on and off vm
	
now to test out in turle sim use:
	roscore
	rosrun joy joy_node --i think for real too
	rosrun turtlesim turtlesim_node 
	rosrun new_robot_urdf moveTurtleSim.py 
	#had errors, but when i changed shebang from #!/usr/bin/env python to #!/usr/bin/env python3 worked fine. 

ls /dev/input
sudo jstest /dev/input/js2
roscore
sudo jstest /dev/input/js2

roscore
rosparam set joy_node/dev "/dev/input/js2"
rosrun joy joy_node 
new term cd nasa
source
roslaunch new.. nasa
new term
cd nasa
source
rosrun new.. moveRobot.py


3/29/21
installed pip install PyQtGraph
for the plot in rqt

3/30/22
installed robotics plugin for rqt
sudo apt-get install ros-%YOUR_ROS_DISTRO%-rqt-robot-plugins 
	not working not supported for melodic
will git clone the rqt_rviz from github to the ros ws src
apparently already have it installed, find out how to import into the dashboard

copied the rqt_rviz package/plugin from the ros catkin ws to nasa_ws/src, then ran catkin_make in home dir, then was able to see rviz. 

3/6/22
convert files and workspace to use python2
currently files use python3 and catkin_make does not work

figure out how to use github with new comp

may need to create a new branh or repo to reset all the changes?
